//Instructions:
//        Write a complete Java program in a class named MuchBetter.java that prints the following output without using multi-line comments:
//
//        Output:
//        A "quoted" String is
//        'much' better if you learn
//        the rules of "escape sequences."
//        Also, "" represents an empty String.
//        Don't forget: use \" instead of " !
//        '' is not the same as "
//
//
//
